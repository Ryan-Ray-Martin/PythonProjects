Description of test suite:

The test suite in the Othello program is quite similar to
the test suit in the Pacman program. 

The specifications of the game that are tested include the
number of spaces that remain after a player moves, so this 
tests the effectiveness of the game controller class and 
start game method.

The edge cases for this test involve testing how many spaces remain
if no player moves (12), and how many spaces remain when all the spaces
are filled up (0). Since this is only a 4 X 4 grid, only those edge
cases and a few others are needed. 

In addition, the display in the move class must be tested as well
to ensure the players turns are following game logic, so after
the black gamepiece is placed, a white gamepiece must be placed.
This test basically just tests the boolean which represents
the black and white player gamepieces. The edge case in this test
is when all spaces are filled up, the assertion must show None, 
since no players will be making a move here. 

That concludes the test suite.
